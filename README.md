# Decision_tree

## üìå Overview
This repository contains two small projects that demonstrate the use of *Decision Tree Classifiers* for classification tasks:
1. *Predicting High Salary (>100k)* ‚Äì Predict whether a person earns more than 100k per year using label encoding.
2. *Predicting Titanic Survival* ‚Äì Classifying whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on personal and travel details.

## üìñ About Decision Trees
A Decision Tree is a *supervised learning algorithm* used for both classification and regression.  
It works by splitting data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where:
- *Nodes* represent features
- *Edges* represent decision rules
- *Leaves* represent output labels

The model selects splits that maximize *information gain* (classification) or minimize *variance* (regression).

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## üìÇ Projects Included
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting High Salary (>100k)
